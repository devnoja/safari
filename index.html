                Welcome to our site let's begin our safari
              </h1>
              <p>
                A safari is a journey. This is the meaning of the word in
                Swahili, the language of East Africa. Your journey into Africa
                starts with Tanzania-Experience. When you join us on safari you
                will be met at the airport, taken to a hotel or a central
                meeting point and briefed before you set off. You will be
                transported in a well-maintained, clean Toyota 4×4 safari
                vehicle, driven by a professional local guide in areas that will
                leave you breathless with wonder and excitement. You will search
                for the ‘Big Five’ – buffalo, elephant, leopard, lion and rhino
                – and will be amazed by the sheer beauty of grass-covered
                savannas, extinct volcanoes and rare birds. You will see
                animals, landscapes and flowers and you will meet the local
                people and taste local food.

              <h3>Adventure camping safari</h3>
              <p>
                On our adventure camping safaris you will be immersed in the
                East African wilderness. You will travel on rough adventurous
                roads, pass tiny rural settlements and see fascinating
                landscapes and abundant wildlife. All your senses will be
                involved; from smelling early morning coffee, experiencing the
                thrill of a kill to the chill of a morning game drive. Falling
                asleep to the hooting of an owl or waking up with the roaring of
                a lion is what you will experience. The safari experience is all
                the more intense as you are ‘right in the middle’ of it all. The
                nearness to the nature, especially at night with its nocturnal
                sounds, compensates for the luxury of a lodge. Our camping
                safaris in Tanzania offer all of this and are therefore perfect
                for nature lovers and those who are looking for a break from
                civilisation and its comforts. Camping is to experience East
                Africa’s nature, animals and cultures in an affordable way.
