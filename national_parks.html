              <p>
                The Park can be divided into 3 sections. The popular
                southern/central part (Seronera Valley), is what the Maasai
                called the “serengit”, the land of endless plains. It’s classic
                savannah, dotted with acacias and filled with wildlife. The
                western corridor is marked by the Grumeti River, and has more
                forests and dense bush. The north, Lobo area, meets up with
                Kenya’s Masai Mara Reserve, is the least visited section.

                The main feature of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area include the
                Ngorongoro Crater, The Serengeti Plains that support about 2.0
                millions migratory wildlife species of the Serengeti
                Mara-ecosystem and the catchment forest; the Northern Highland
                Forest Reserve known as 'Entim Olturot' in Maasai language.
                Other important features found in the NCA are the archaeological
                and palaeontological site located at Oldupai Gorge and the early
                human foot-prints that were discovered at Alaitole in Ngarusi
                area.

              <p>
                The alkaline soda of Lake Manyara is home to an incredible array
                of bird life that thrives on its brackish waters. Pink flamingo
                stoop and graze by the thousands colourful specks against the
                grey minerals of the lake shore. Yellow-billed storks swoop and
                corkscrew on thermal winds rising up from the escarpment, and
                herons flap their wings against the sun-drenched sky. Even
                reluctant bird-watchers will find something to watch and marvel
                at within the national park.
